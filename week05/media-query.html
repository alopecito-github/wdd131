            <p>And now, my sons, I would that ye should remember to search them diligently, that ye may profit thereby;
                and I would that ye should keep the commandments of God, that ye may prosper in the land according to
                the promises which the Lord made unto our fathers.</p>

            <h2>Moises 6:63</h2>
            <p>And behold, all things have their likeness, and all things are created and made to bear record of me,
                both things which are temporal, and things which are spiritual; things which are in the heavens above,
                and things which are on the earth, and things which are in the earth, and things which are under the
                earth, both above and beneath: all things bear record of me.</p>
